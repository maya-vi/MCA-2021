# Musas: Un Homenaje al Folclore Latinoamericano en Manos de Los Macorinos   
## An Homage to Latin American Folk

*Musas is a two-part collection of music from singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade, in collaboration with guitarist-duo Los Macorinos. Throughout this project, Lafourcade explores the historical and cultural sounds of Latin American music.*

The datasets related to the theme of this portfolio have not been formally curated or archived. Descriptive, Notational, and Acoustic Data can be found, although it requires effort, primarily in locating transcribed versions of the traditional songs as they were interpreted by Lafourcade.
